<p>The United Nations Association (UNA) exists to promote a deeper public awareness of and support for the role of the United Nations in global affairs. We run specific campaigns to urge a greater commitment to the UN by the British Government of the day and interest ourselves in the inter-related issues of arms control and disarmament; of economic and social development; of environmental care; of population; of human rights; of peacekeeping and non-violent conflict resolution and of fostering international friendship.</p>
