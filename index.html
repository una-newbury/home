<p>The United Nations Association (UNA) exists to promote a deeper public awareness of and support for the role of the United Nations in global affairs. We run specific campaigns to urge a greater commitment to the UN by the British Government of the day and interest ourselves in the inter-related issues of arms control and disarmament; of economic and social development; of environmental care; of population; of human rights; of peacekeeping and non-violent conflict resolution and of fostering international friendship.</p>

<p>UNA/UK is a membership-based organisation lobbying Parliament on international issues, including the UN Agencies, peacekeeping, development, human rights, and refugees. We especially welcome other nationalities. Speakers include campaign issues, especially the UN Climate Change Conferences, Coffee Mornings, Annual Dinner, UN Day Celebration and One World Week. We have held the Holocaust Memorial Day commemoration. A bursary is available for young people u/25 to attend conferences and study tours.</p>
